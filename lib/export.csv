The banquet symposium paintings have been removed, but they commemorate feasts specific to this house and its owners. The socle represents typical fourth style paintings. On the east wall, there is a large notched area with an extrusion (painted) next to the couch niche (also painted red with the plants perhaps a aloe vera plant like the one currently in the peristyle). The second panel area has a stenciled divider with a white background. These panels have red, yellow and gold. There are large black rectangular frames with vaulted tops. There panels include interior gold stencil frames. There are eight such panels. There are three intriguing banquet scenes that have been removed. The remaining panels show winged figures (sexist and very cute). The black panels are divided by the yellow panels which there are 11.

The decoration in the panels are difficult to discern, but may have been a garden scene, although to judge from the decoration on the northwest wall there may have been a small panel within each larger panel. The decoration on the northwest wall is divided into three sections with an overall erotic theme. The western most section shows a framework of vines with birds at the top. In the upper left hand corner appears to be a cluster of phalli. A large phallus is in the center with two smaller phalli below. All three incorporated within the outline of a larger phallus.

The long side of the water channel runs along the entire length of the northwest wall, while the shorter section runs on the corner of the southwestern wall and is provided with a drain hole opening off the street. To the north of the entrance on the northwestern wall is a large window that looks out onto Room 5, (dining room).

More traces of painting appear on the southern corner of the southeastern wall: A red band which could have framed a panel. Fragments of plaster are visible on the southeastern and northeastern walls. On the southwestern wall, next to the water channel, there is a cistern which is now covered by two stone blocks. The southern corner of the room is delimited by an L-shaped low wall. This was probably a covered room, as a row of 16 joist holes are on the southwest wall. They may have supported the ceiling of this room. Eschebach describes this space as a storeroom, (repositorium) though its location in a large area, the paintings, and the possible arrangement of a garden with the water channel, suggest that the walled space may have been used as a dining room with a nice vista onto the garden. High up in the southeastern wall, above the longer wall, delimiting the dining room is a glass window which appears to be modern. The ground is covered in vegetation. In the southern corner of the southeastern wall there is evidence of a door which was walled up and covered with painting.

It is a long rectangular room which is along a northeast/southwest axis. The area is divided in two differently sized spaces. The longer side to the northeast lays on a platform about twenty centimeters above the lower, shorter side. This space, which was used to hold dining couches, is floored with an octagonal grid of white marble poised squares. What is left today is seven rows of poised squares. The three walls (northwest, northeast, southeast) have plaster fragments with small traces of red and black painting. They are preserved to the first floor height. The ceiling is not extant, but a modern reconstruction is present. The lower section of Room 10, which lies to the southwest of the couch area is more open space as it contains two entrances; one to the northwest and one to the southeast. The room has a very large square window looking out on to Room 11 to the southwest. The step to the platform of the dining area was painted in black and red but today only small fragments remain. The walls were also decorated. The southern section of the southeastern wall shows a large white panel divided by slightly recessed red bands. On the opposite wall, to the northwest, there are again traces of white painted panels with slightly recessed red bands. The lower register was divided into two bands of different colors: black and red. On the western wall in the southwestern corner there is evidence of a blocked door which has traces of plaster at the bottom. The walls are preserved to the first story. The floor is made of cocciopesto with some white marble poset squares inserted in the middle of the room toward the large window. However, as this area is accessed by a raised wooden platform it is not possible to discern if this decoration continues.

The northwestern portion of the euripius is ornamented with a semicircular vaulted niche supported by four little steps. In the middle of this painted niche is a hole for spouting water. The informative panel says that ""The fruit trees... were there in antiquity. The root holes of these original trees were found... There was a double row of smaller trees, which scholars at the time identified as quince and pomegranate trees.

Against this wall and very close to the masonry triclinium rests a square pilaster which is about 40 cm high.  The NW wall above the masonry triclinium is entirely preserved; it is decorated with red plaster and at approximately 2.5 meters high two small rectangular openings appear on either side of a rectangular window looking out on the adjoining property.  This section of the wall continues running to the SW but it is not well preserved.  It shows traces of plaster.  The area delineated b y this wall contains two wells which are today covered/protected by a fence.  At the end of this area next to the triclinium is a small structure which appears that could have been used as a support.  The garden area delineated by the colonnade porticus is today ornamented with planters and a vine-covered pergola.

The triclinium is located in the northwest corner of the Dining Garden Peristyle. It faces east. The medius is 4.5m, immus 4.2 and summis 3.55 (Jashemski). At the end of the summus one can see a white painted stucco. The bottom part shows the typical painted garden fence and the top part is gone. There is a large rectangular center table with a pipe coming up out of the center. This triclinium shows 13 aedicular arched recesses. The triclinium shows the typical slopes. There is a wall surrounding the south, west, and north sides of the triclinium. Jashemski shows this wall as a low masonry wall with space for plants. There are four round columns, one at each corner, that would have supported a pergola. There is evidence of stucco on the west column. To the northeast and southeast in front of the triclinium are two large ornate fountains. The dominant tesserae colors are white, deep blue, light blue, coral, and green. At the back of each fountain are stairs that go to the top. Jashemski reports that Stephano DeCaro that the steps led to the reservoirs. The fountains are almost duplicates of each other. The north facade will be described. It has a large niche in a rectangular block that has a pediment at the top. There is a rectangular pool area in front of each fountain. The large arched niche contains a smaller niche with a protruding marble shelf. The north fountain still contains a center water pipe coming up through the bottom. The interior niche contains shells with outlining in green and red tesserae, Both fountains, beneath the small niche, show two ducks and two fish. At the top of the large niche is a flying swan, clearly 4th style. At the middle zone of the fountain are two green jumping dolphins. The shells are everywhere on the facade, probably modern restoration. The north water fountain contains a small circular marble table, which may or may not have been there originally.

We cross a white marble threshold which has post holes and tracks. There is a high modern lintel and plaster on both sides of the door jam with evidence of red and white paint. The room runs along a northeast southwest axis. In antiquity it appears that the walls were painted with a reddish color framed by darker red panels and stenciling. Evidence is most prominent on the northwest wall. However all four walls suggest the same motifs. On the southwest wall is a large window which gives view to a large peristyle of the Corinthian style. In the corner of the southwest- northwest walls there remains a pillar constructed of brick covered with painted plaster to match the walls and extending to first story level. In the north portion of the northwest wall is a large deep niche (3149). The walls are in disrepair; however they reach first story height.

Immediately on the northeast wall is a large cooking platform above which is a small narrowing window to the street. Centered along the northeast wall there are four holes which suggest support for shelving. A second window on this northeast wall is higher and wider than the first. The northeast wall curves eventually forming the northwest wall of the room. Within this curve, adjacent to the aforementioned window, is a modern lintel which has apparently replaced an arch contiguous to the large oven(3150). This structure along with the curved wall forms an irregular space which could have been used for kneading. The area did not receive a separate designation as a room due to the lack of a pass through to the oven. The major portion of the northwest wall is the large oven which projects directly into the space. Another archway which adjoins the northwest wall and extends to the southwest of the short end of the L-shape provides entrance to the remaining spaces which are also designated by smaller arches. The large, low, wide arch (3144) on the southeast wall possibly for grain storage is plastered. The arch which is the southwest most portion of the room houses a well (3152) and has a hole above in the arch itself for passage of water. On the northwest wall just north of the well is entrance to room 29. There is a large water basin north of the oven. The archway and oven wall are mostly brick and volcanic. The height of walls appear to be preserved to first story height and the floors obscured with lapilli and broken bricks. There is no ceiling extant.

The floor is white tesserae, in the dining area with a black border on 4 sides. The interior to the dining area contains ten individual columns. The two columns, seen at the entrance appear to be attached to large round pilasters.. The fluted columns hold an arch with pseudo ionic columns with traces of yellow paint. Each of the ten individual columns sits on a square base. The square bases are painted with traces of first style in yellow architectural design. At the top of the columns, there is a second level of continuous architrove. the columns define an interior dining area with separate corridors, situated on the North and South sides. the 2 columns situated at the back of the room are centered to the entrance.  There is a varying different geometric mosaic with a white and black pattern seen between the columns. When facing into the dining room, the wall is directly to the right. There are 3 registars. On the bottom register, there are 5 distinct patterns of red paint.

On the lower register, in the Northern corner is a black panel which features a cloaked male, resting on the figure of a bull. This pattern of black is contiguous with the Northeast wall, which depicts other figures, 2 of which are reclining and one central figure, who is squatting and appears to be holding the doorway above him. At the Eastern corner of the Southeast wall, a figure, possibly representing Venus, appears to be resting on a dolphin.

Today this room has a huge ugly modern table covered with a tarp and unusable boxes. Underneath this is a rectangular marble tiled floor design mostly greyish white marble. The central coloured marble feature in the floor (which would not have been covered by dining benches) contains feature tiles of red and white marble. Two windows are present in the room. Protective wood awnings well above eye level are present over painted areas on three walls. All that can now be seen on the west covered picture may be a deer. A large chunk has been randomly cut out near signs of a dark turquoise sky (?) with a red frame. The lower dado is black and shows green plant forms as in fourth style. The protective awning on the north wall has no painting evident though the dado and its plants remain.

A beam hole high above may indicate an upper story, but it is uncertain based upon the remains.  The wall has remnants of plaster covering it with traces of red paint.  There is a tag stating that parts of the wall were restored in 1985.  The northwest wall also has some traces of plaster with red paint and is made of opus incertum.

One enters from the southwest. The L shaped counter blocks part of the opening, leaving a narrow passageway by the south corner of the threshold. The threshold is at sidewalk level. The cooking platform directly abuts the south corner between the southeast and southwest walls. Situated directly above the cooking platform about 70 centimeters from the cooking platform surface is a narrow rectangular indentation. Seen much higher up on the same wall is a fairly square opening, topped with a piece of terra cotta which may indicate the presence of an upper story. There are several other scattered cuts, jutting into the wall, but its impossible to determine if they are identical or due to site destruction. The northeast wall contains five doorways with stone thresholds. They lead to back serving rooms and are constructed of large blocks. Each doorway has a course of bricks and stone situated above, giving it the appearance of an arch. A little plaster remains on this wall and it was originally painted red. The northwest wall appears to be mostly reconstruct-ed. Remains of red painted fresco are found on the bottom, running under the storage in the northwest corner. A rectangular opening indicates something inserted into the wall, it's situated directly above some of the red plaster. Stepped shelves, are stretching from counter (6704) to the southwest wall.

A wall would have extended for approximately a quarter of the space from the S.W. side, to the step. The long S.W. wall contains slight occasional traces of plaster. Situated, directly behind the small wall, on the S.W. side, the remains of a ceramic pipe descends through the wall from the floor above. Through discussion, it was considered; a possibility of the pipe leading to a latrine, but this was not confirmed by the available evidence.Situated, high toward the top of the wall are post holes indicating an upper story was present. A round hole seen half way up the wall may have indicated something was attached. For the next item, there was a door that was blocked off in antiquity. All walls are constructed of opus incertum.Moving to the N.W. wall, it appears to be closed off from the property, situated behind in antiquity. Scattered bits of plaster remain, but nothing that can provide a clear idea of how the room was decorated. To the N.E., we have the stepped wall that provides the bottom portion of the L.The furthest portion to the N.E., is simple opus incertim, while the S.E. shows some old block construction, also. As the wall rejoins the long portion of the L, there is an indentation for a well (3982) and a lararium (   ). The lararium is situated directly to the N.E., as you enter from the steps and had a rectangular construction with a canted roof, comprised of a 30 degree angle leading up from the N.E. to the East.

We have determined that the last usage of this room (4043) was as a dining room.  This identification is based on: a) the location of the room off the peristyle and colonnade; b) characteristics of the room including a monumental entrance aligned with a view of a pediment at the entrance to the colonnade,  peristyle, and garden.  The pediment suggests a temple facade. There is an elaborate mosaic in the center of the room and elaborate wall paintings.   In addition to the large entrance in the center, there is also a smaller entrance at the west end of the southwest wall where there appears to be traces of door jambs.  The exterior of this wall, along the colonnade, shows traces of plaster and paint which has been reconstructed.  The floor of this room is mosaic, white with a black border.  The center of the floor is paved in opus sectile in geometric designs in varying colors.  The ceiling no longer exists; however, the walls are tall, with paintings in three registers.  The wall has been reconstructed.  There appear to be three registers with traces of painting in the middle register on the south side of the wall.  The color scheme is black, yellow, green and red.  There is a figure set in painted architecture on the south side.  On the same wall, west side, in the upper register, there are traces of decoration.  On the northwest wall there are fine paintings in the middle register.   The paintings contain architectural structures.  The central panel is a picture that we cannot identify, however there is a sketch showing the legs and feet.  Along the border at the bottom of the central panel there are cupids racing in small carts with goats or deer.  On the north end of this wall there is a tondo painting of Mars and Venus.  Below the Mars and Venus there is a scene showing six figures.  The northeast wall is in three major panels separated by architectural design.  On the north side of this wall there is another tondo but it is unidentifiable.  The central panel  has been cut out.  The central panel is flanked by architectural features.  The north panel is painted, the east panel was in the process of being painted, with the artist's original sketches in situ.  On the easternmost side in the middle register, there is a painting of Ceres holding a staff.  Possibly the southeast wall is reconstructed.

We have determined that the usage of the space is the Castellum Aquae based on the following criteria: - The location of the structure, which aligns with the aqueduct which enters the city at this point, and which can be seen with a maintenance hole outside the wall which is directly aligned with the water inlet channel.- This is a food and drink feature because it delivers drinking water to the city.This is a domed structure with a fully plastered surface (hydraulic plaster). Three windows are cut deeply through the dome on the East side and the South, and over the door in the South West. The only door is on the South West side. This is a low doorway.The system is designed so that water enters through the inlet at the North West side, filling the central basin. The floor of the basin slopes downwards to the tripartite outlet at the South East side. The water is channeled from the basin in three directions by raised dividers. A cutting to the North West of the divides most likely held movable doors. The water, once it is divided, is channeled downward to the three cut outlets. The perimeter from the doorway going West around to the outlet is a catwalk. This is symmetrically echoed on the North East side of the space. to the South of the door is a narrow, raised space, which is echoed on the Eastern side.The damaged condition of the walls surrounding the outlets does not preserve the continuation of this raised platform on the South East side. A small drainhole is located through the basin wall just to the North East of the door and may have drained water into the basin that seeped in through the doorway. In general the condition of the hydraulic cement is very good. The exterior of this building is a one storey square structure, set on a gray tufa stone socoe. The structure is brick. The facade on the South East side to the brickwork is in the form of three arches. This decorative treatment offers an aesthetically pleasing side to the city. The building is built right into the city wall, which can be seen on the North East and North West sides.The water outlets on the South East side are within the central archway and the stone level of the street would have presumably covered the start of the distribution pipes.

The room is entered from the south east by a very tall narrow bricked doorway with a marble sill with indentations that show door hardware attachment. The room is rectangular on a northwest southeast axis. Fresco is found on all walls with a red dado and white or perhaps yellow above. The northeast and northwest walls were constructed of opus incertum. The southwest wall appears appears to be constructed of masonry fill with brick courses. The door wall is reconstructed but shows traces of opus incertum above the door header. The north east,north west and south west walls have high post holes indicating the presence of an upper storey. Today a reconstructed ceiling covers the room. Evenly spaced in three rows into the thick plaster are squared post holes. There is a series of three by three on the south west wall, a series of two by two on the north west wall, and a series of one row of three on the north west wall.

This identification has been made based upon the location of the tomb immediately outside the city gates on the street of tombs. The tomb was heavily restored in 1977. Today the tomb consists of two low walls with benches to the southeast and southwest of a vaulted niche opening (features 6595 and 6591). The opening is arched and the interior runs on a north-south axis. Running on each wall on the east and west sides are low benches preceding (feature sheets 6593 and 6592). The chamber is entered via the south over a stone threshold. The south wall of the tomb shows slight traces of painted plaster and a rectangular niche in the center of the wall.

Room number 15 we have identified to be a dining hall based on its large structure and its location directly adjacent to the peristyle court (11). The room sits on a north-west south-east axis with a large entry door on the south-east wall. The walls were originally made of opus incertum and were covered with a series of elaborate frescoes. The dado is black with ten human figures visible between areas of candelabra-style decoration. Directly above on all walls is a narrow band with red insets interspersed with ten small insets  with black background of mythological scenes. On top of that is a black band with the very famous paintings of cupids in various occupations. Ten occupations are currently visible with probably three removed or ruined from the south-west wall. On all three walls on the north-west end of the room directly above that are main panels with central figures (usually two individuals) divided by black vertical stripes of candelabra and floating figures. four of those paired figures remain intact, one is partially destroyed, and at least two appear to have been removed, probably to a museum. There is an architectural frieze with human figures above that in the same end of the room. More painting used to exists throughout, but some of the fresco is in ruined condition (see photos). On the north-east wall high above the door height where there is no plaster we see two squared post-holes which may be from reconstruction. A matching hole appears on the south-west wall. At the south corner of the same wall above door height is a square pass-through window looking towards room (14). Below that window is a narrow doorway connecting rooms (14) and (15). The door is located on the south-east wall and has a very small square window centred above it. The ceiling is reconstructed plaster but what may be original ceramic roof tiles are visible between pieces of broken plaster. The floor is currently lined with wood and is not visible.

The upper portion of the walls and roof are restored and the lower walls are frescoed and painted.  The dado is black with red, green and yellow lines setting off what appears to be garden symbolism. The main panels are red and it is only on the NW wall does any trace of painting remain in the form of a centrally located primary panel.

This door also has a stone threshold and one steps down to the level of the dining room floor, although at the time of this visit the room is undergoing restoration and the floor is mostly covered.  We can see traces of a cocciopesto surface.  The walls are well preserved in height with a small, high window centrally placed in the northeast wall.  The painting decoration was first style with a dado supporting large panels, which may have been black separated by vertical red bands.  Above this panel level is a section of plaster encrustation (rectangular forms imitating colored stone blocks).  There are horizontal bands of plaster molding, one above and another below these rectangular blocks, best  preserved on the northeast and southeast walls.  On the northwest wall an arched molding springs from the north corner attesting to a vaulted ceiling on a northwest-southeast axis.  The ceiling above is reconstructed.

Directly below the window are a series of 8 post holes that appears to be in a semicircular pattern. The southwest wall is partially destroyed, making it unclear as to whether there was a second access door (I think not).",61,,,,48315,,49215,07/09/2015,,8,,4145,4145,,,Yes,,Yes,0,Yes,3,,07/09/2015,14,4102,,,,,,,,,47915,,"Lee PayneRob BrownAaron Randall",49215,07/07/2015,,5,9,63,,2015,4148,4201,Space or Room,0,,58,,,,007,,Mary Meier,2015,Jean Kelley-Joyce,"2015"
